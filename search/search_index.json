You can specify version by\nincluding it in the request path:\n\n\n1\nhttps://api.pokedevs.bastionbot.org/v{version_number}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmitting the version number from the route will route requests to the current\ndefault version. We recommend specifying a version number in the request path\nso that your app doesn\nt run into incompatibility when the default version is\nchanged.\n\n\n\n  \nAPI Versions\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nVersion\n\n      \nStatus\n\n      \nDefault\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \n1\n\n      \nAvailable\n\n      \n\u2713\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication\n#\n\n\nNo authentication is required to access this API. All the resources are and\navailable to everyone. However, we will implement authentication methods in the\nfuture that will give authenticated users higher \nrate limits\n\nor no \nrate limits\n at all (more on \nrate limits\n\nlater).\n\n\nUser Agent\n#\n\n\nApplications and websites using the API must provide a valid \nUser Agent\n\nwhich specifies information about the app and website, in the following format:\n\n\n1\nUser-Agent: AppName ($url, $version)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications and websites may append more information and metadata to the end of\nthis string as they wish.\n\n\nExample User Agent Header\n#\n\n\n1\nUser-Agent: BastionDiscordBot (https://bastionbot.org, 6.3.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate Limiting\n#\n\n\nThis API implements a process for limiting and preventing excessive requests in\naccordance with \nRFC 6585\n.\n\n\nThis API rate limits requests in order to prevent abuse and overload of our\nservices. Rate limits are applied on a global basis, spanning across the entire\nAPI.\n\n\nBecause we may change rate limits at any time and rate limits can be\ndifferent per application, rate limits should not be hard coded into your\napplication or website. In order to properly support our dynamic rate\nlimits, your application or website should parse for our rate limits in\nresponse headers and locally prevent exceeding of the limits as they change.\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nCurrent rate limit is 500 API calls in 12 hours. And we will increase the\nrate limits every time we upgrade our server for better performance.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend that your application or website should locally cache the\ndata that you receive to save the number of API calls consumed for the same\nresource.\n\n\nHeader Format\n#\n\n\nFor every API request made, we return optional HTTP response headers containing\nthe rate limit encountered during your request.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 500\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 201\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 905212800000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX-RateLimit-Limit - The number of requests that can be made\n\n\nX-RateLimit-Remaining - The number of remaining requests that can be made\n\n\nX-RateLimit-Reset - Epoch time (seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1,\n    1970) at which the rate limit resets.
