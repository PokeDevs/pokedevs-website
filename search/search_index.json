You can specify version by\nincluding it in the request path:\n\n\n1\nhttps://pokeapi.bastionbot.org/v{version_number}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmitting the version number from the route will route requests to the current\ndefault version. We recommend specifying a version number in the request path\nso that your app doesn\nt run into incompatibility when the default version is\nchanged.\n\n\n\n  \nAPI Versions\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nVersion\n\n      \nStatus\n\n      \nDefault\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \n1\n\n      \nAvailable\n\n      \n\u2713\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication\n#\n\n\nNo authentication is required to access this API. All the resources are and\navailable to everyone. However, we will implement authentication methods in the\nfuture that will give authenticated users higher \nrate limits\n\nor no \nrate limits\n at all (more on \nrate limits\n\nlater).\n\n\nUser Agent\n#\n\n\nApplications and websites using the API must provide a valid \nUser Agent\n\nwhich specifies information about the app and website, in the following format:\n\n\n1\nUser-Agent: AppName ($url, $version)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications and websites may append more information and metadata to the end of\nthis string as they wish.\n\n\nExample User Agent Header\n#\n\n\n1\nUser-Agent: BastionDiscordBot (https://bastionbot.org, 6.3.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate Limiting\n#\n\n\nThis API implements a process for limiting and preventing excessive requests in\naccordance with \nRFC 6585\n.\n\n\nThis API rate limits requests in order to prevent abuse and overload of our\nservices. Rate limits are applied on a global basis, spanning across the entire\nAPI.\n\n\nBecause we may change rate limits at any time and rate limits can be\ndifferent per application, rate limits should not be hard coded into your\napplication or website. In order to properly support our dynamic rate\nlimits, your application or website should parse for our rate limits in\nresponse headers and locally prevent exceeding of the limits as they change.\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nCurrent rate limit is 500 API calls in 12 hours. And we will increase the\nrate limits every time we upgrade our server for better performance.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend that your application or website should locally cache the\ndata that you receive to save the number of API calls consumed for the same\nresource.\n\n\nHeader Format\n#\n\n\nFor every API request made, we return optional HTTP response headers containing\nthe rate limit encountered during your request.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nRetry-After: 1301000\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 500\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 201\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 905212800000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetry-After - The number of milliseconds after which the rate limit will\n    reset.

It is returned only if you\nve been\n    rate limited.\n\n\n\n\nExceeding A Rate Limit\n#\n\n\nIn the case that a rate limit is exceeded, the API will return a HTTP 429\nresponse code with a JSON body.\n\n\n\n  \nRate Limit Response Structure\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nField\n\n      \nType\n\n      \nDescription\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nerror\n\n      \ninteger\n\n      \nThe HTTP response code.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nmessage\n\n      \nstring\n\n      \nA message saying you are being rate limited.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nretry_after\n\n      \ninteger\n\n      \nThe number of milliseconds to wait before submitting another request.\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the normal rate-limiting headers will be sent in this response.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nAPI users that regularly hit and ignore rate limits will be banned (by their\nIP address) from using the API again.\n\n\n\n\nExample Rate Limit Response\n#\n\n\nThe rate-limiting response will look something like the following:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n HTTP/1.1 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS\n\n Content-Type: application/json\n\n Retry-After: 14400000\n\n X-RateLimit-Limit: 500\n\n X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0\n\n X-RateLimit-Reset: 905212800000\n{\n  \nerror\n: 429,\n  \nmessage\n: \nYou are being rate limited.\n,\n  \nretry_after\n: 14400000\n}",

That\ns exactly why I started working on this project. I needed a\nPok\u00e9mon API to integrate it with my Discord Bot (\nBastion\n).\nSo I started looking for different sources for a reliable and updated Pok\u00e9mon\nAPI.\n\nI found very reliable and up-to-date sites like \nPok\u00e9mon Database\n\nand \nBulbapedia\n, but they didn\nt had any\npublic facing APIs, that was the first bump. And the sites I found that provided\nan API were not up-to-date. At the time of writing, a complete generation,\ngeneration 7 (Sun \n Moon) to be exact, was missing after months of its release\nin the TV. It was clear that I couldn\nt rely on them for updated Pok\u00e9mon data.\nSo, I thought of writing my own API and keeping it updated as soon as new\nPok\u00e9mon are released.\n\n\nHow did I did this?\n#\n\n\nIt took around a week to manually enter all the Pok\u00e9dex data into a dataset.\nThen I designed \n developed the RESTful API server, tested it and wrote the\ndocumentation. And here we are, with the \nPok\u00e9dex API\n of the \nPok\u00e9mon\nDevelopers\n project.\n\n\nWhat\ns the final product?\n#\n\n\nThe \nPok\u00e9dex API\n is a RESTful API interface to a lot of data about Pok\u00e9mon\nand related stuff that you can consume. We specifically cover the \nPok\u00e9mon anime series\n\nof the \nPok\u00e9mon franchise\n.\nAnd we\nd love to cover the video game and the Pok\u00e9mon Go game in the future.\n\nAnd this website provides you with the documentation on how to use our API so\nthat you can make awesome apps or websites that need Pok\u00e9mon data. You can get\ninformation on all the Pok\u00e9mon that exist in the Pok\u00e9mon World, leagues,\nevolutionary stones and egg groups and a lot more (and a LOT LOT more in the\nfuture).\n\n\nBut wait, who am I?\n#\n\n\nSo, the answer to the final question, I\nm \nSankarsan Kampa\n,\n\na.k.a. k3rn31p4nic\n.

I needed a\nPok\u00e9mon API to integrate it with my Discord Bot ( Bastion ).\nSo I started looking for different sources for a reliable and updated Pok\u00e9mon\nAPI. \nI found very reliable and up-to-date sites like  Pok\u00e9mon Database \nand  Bulbapedia , but they didn t had any\npublic facing APIs, that was the first bump. And the sites I found that provided\nan API were not up-to-date. At the time of writing, a complete generation,\ngeneration 7 (Sun   Moon) to be exact, was missing after months of its release\nin the TV. It was clear that I couldn t rely on them for updated Pok\u00e9mon data.\nSo, I thought of writing my own API and keeping it updated as soon as new\nPok\u00e9mon are released.",
