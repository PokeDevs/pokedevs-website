That\ns exactly why I started working on this project. I needed a\nPok\u00e9mon API to integrate it with my Discord Bot (\nBastion\n).\nSo I started looking for different sources for a reliable and updated Pok\u00e9mon\nAPI.\n\nI found very reliable and up-to-date sites like \nPok\u00e9mon Database\n\nand \nBulbapedia\n, but they didn\nt had any\npublic facing APIs, that was the first bump. And the sites I found that provided\nan API were not up-to-date.
