!!! info
    If you are a developer and have made any wrapper library that can be used by
    anyone to power their application or website, we'd love to showcase your
    library here.  
    Contact us in our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/7P4H3TY) to
    get your library verified. Once it gets verified you'll get a super
    cool **Library Dev** role and a special channel for your library in our
    Discord Server which you can use to provide support to your library users
    and attract more users to use your library.
