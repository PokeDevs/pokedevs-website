description: Read about the 'why', 'how' and 'what' of the Pokémon Developers project.

## Why did I start this? <small>Aren't there already tons of other APIs?</small>
Yeah, exactly, there are 100s of other Pokémon APIs out there. But they are all
out dated. That's exactly why I started working on this project. I needed a
Pokémon API to integrate it with my Discord Bot ([Bastion](https://bastionbot.org 'Bastion: Discord Bot')).
So I started looking for different sources for a reliable and updated Pokémon
API.  
I found very reliable and up-to-date sites like [Pokémon Database](https://pokemondb.net/)
and [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/), but they didn't had any
public facing APIs, that was the first bump. And the sites I found that provided
an API were not up-to-date. At the time of writing, a complete generation,
generation 7 (Sun & Moon) to be exact, was missing after months of its release
in the TV. It was clear that I couldn't rely on them for updated Pokémon data.
So, I thought of writing my own API and keeping it updated as soon as new
Pokémon are released.

## How did I did this?
It took around a week to manually enter all the Pokédex data into a dataset.
Then I designed & developed the RESTful API server, tested it and wrote the
documentation. And here we are, with the **Pokédex API** of the **Pokémon
Developers** project.

## What's the final product?
The **Pokédex API** is a RESTful API interface to a lot of data about Pokémon
and related stuff that you can consume. We specifically cover the [Pokémon anime series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28anime%29 'Pokémon (anime)')
of the [Pokémon franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon 'Pokémon').
And we'd love to cover the video game and the Pokémon Go game in the future.  
And this website provides you with the documentation on how to use our API so
that you can make awesome apps or websites that need Pokémon data. You can get
information on all the Pokémon that exist in the Pokémon World, leagues,
evolutionary stones and egg groups and a lot more (and a LOT LOT more in the
future).

## But wait, who am I?
So, the answer to the final question, I'm [Sankarsan Kampa](https://sankarsankampa.com),
*a.k.a. k3rn31p4nic*. You can find me on GitHub [@k3rn31p4nic](https://github.com/k3rn31p4nic),
on Twitter [@k3rn31p4nic](https://twitter.com/k3rn31p4nic) or on Discord as
**k3rn31p4nic#8383** in any of my Discord Servers, [Bastion](https://discord.gg/fzx8fkt)
or [Pokémon Developers]().
